  <h1>Dear Miss Wong,</h1>
  <p>Thank you for teaching me English. You are very helpful and have taught me a lot. Your kindness has also made a difference. Whenever I didn't know the answer, you always help me with my homework and teach me the things I don’t know. I am very grateful to you!</p>
  <p>Your student,<br>Lucas</p>
