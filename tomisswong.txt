Dear Miss Wong,

     Thank you for teaching me English. You are very helpful and have taught me a lot. Your kindness has also made a difference. Whenever I didn't know the answer, you always help me with my homework and teach me the things I donâ€™t know. I am very grateful to you!

Your student
Lucas
